# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: January 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through week 3 of Programming Fundamentals course on Coursera.

**Thoughts:** I don't really like C. I don't like working with binary numbers. It was a good recap of Types in programming.

### Day 1: January 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a Random Meal Generator using fetch API from a recipe database.

**Thoughts:** Fun small project because I'm tired. Fetch API is a fun mechanic in JavaScript.
